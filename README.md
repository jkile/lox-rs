# lox-rs

Currently in progress Rust implementation of the Lox interpreter. This iteration is not necessarily an idiomatic Rust approach, but more an exercise in learning implementing an interpreter alongside the book Crafting Interpreters. As time and progress permits, I'll be revisiting certain components to make them more idiomatic and satisfy my personal need for less mutable state when viable. There is a ton of work needed to make this more scalable which will also happen in time.

For now, enjoy the progress updates!
